## Observations from WeatherPy Analysis

1. From the City Latitude vs. Max Temperature Chart, I orginally thouht the higher temperatures would be seen at the equator, which is Latitude = 0. However, it looks like there is a small shift, and the temperature actually is higher at latitude = 20.
2. From the regression analysis, there is a strong, positive relationship between temperature and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere.
3. From the regression analysis, there is a strong, negative relationship between temperature and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.
4. There is not a strong relationship between temperature and the other variables (Cloudiness, Wind Speed, or Humidity) regardless of Hemisphere.
